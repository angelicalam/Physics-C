Can You Find the Mass-to-Charge Ratio?
========================================

You are given a positively-charged particle of unknown mass.
The electric field and magnetic field are adjustable.
The electric field is in the plane of the page while the magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane of the page.
Ignore gravitational effects.
Press the green button to release the particle. Press the button again to reset the simulation.
Upon choosing the correct closest mass-to-charge ratio, a winning message will be displayed.

This simulation is inspired by the physics concepts behind a mass spectrometer.

To make this simulation, we used the popular visual programming language, Processing,
primarily because processing.js makes our code suitable for a webpage.
